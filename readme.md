## Overview




Fildex is an AMM decentralized exchange built for the FVM chain currently deployed on the hyperspace test net. 


## Problem statement


At present, the Filecoin network already possesses a noticeable user base that holds FIL tokens as a valuable asset with no other asset available to switch to.


## Use cases


With Fildex our aim is to make sure



1. Users on FVM are able to exchange FIL for other tokens issued on-chain and there is enough on-chain liquidity on the FVM
2.  To onboard other Defi users on the FVM chain.
3. To enable liquidity of governance tokens for Dao’s (like data Dao’s) and storage provider incentives.


## Key features




Core features include swapping, unwrapping and wrapping, supplying liquidity, to incentivize – gamification features like lotteries

Swap: Swap between any tokens native and non-native tokens. 

Liquidity pools: Create or supply liquidity for token pairs of your choice and earn trading fees on it.

Lottery: 

* You can win a lottery ticket as an incentive for swapping or buy lottery tickets using fDex tokens.
* You can choose a randomly generated 6-digit lottery number or reroll the number to your choice.
* The lottery pool is distributed among the participants basis on the number matching
* You will be informed via push notifications of your lottery results and can claim the prizes.

Push notifications: Integrating push notifications to provide better UX for use cases such as swaps Successful/failed and Lottery events.
